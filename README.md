These are radiation synthesis tools written in Python based on the [yt project](https://yt-project.org/). 
They could be used to analyze data simulated by [MPI-AMRVAC](https://github.com/amrvac/amrvac), 
but also applicable to other relevant data.

They have the following features:
- Synthesizing optically thin radiation in the Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) wavebands, including SDO/AIA 171, 304, 193, 335, 211, 94, 131 Angstrom.
- Interactive GUI operations of synthesized images.
- Multi perspective views with camera controls.
